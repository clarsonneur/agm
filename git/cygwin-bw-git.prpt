This is the default cygwin prompt with agm and GIT prompts added.
To be honest, I do not recommend it on cygwin because Windows do not deal well with small files/processes.
You can test it, But I suggest you to avoid it for performance consideration.

Note: This prompt like others are working very well under linux.
